Project: User App Feature Completion - Mock Data to Real Database
Spec ID: 001-user-app-completion
Workspace: D:\assign-x
Started: 2026-01-02

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Converting mock implementations to production-ready features with real Supabase database integration and Razorpay payment processing.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 11
- Created init.sh
- Created context.json with files to modify

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Marketplace Backend): 2 subtasks, depends on [], parallel_safe=true
  - Create marketplace server actions with Supabase
  - Update marketplace types to match database schema

- Phase 2 (Payment Backend): 2 subtasks, depends on [], parallel_safe=true
  - Create payment methods server actions
  - Create Razorpay customer API route

- Phase 3 (Marketplace Frontend): 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-1], parallel_safe=false
  - Update Connect page with real data
  - Create listing creation page

- Phase 4 (Payment Frontend): 1 subtask, depends on [phase-2], parallel_safe=false
  - Update Payment Methods page with Razorpay

- Phase 5 (Flutter Verification): 1 subtask, depends on [], parallel_safe=true
  - Verify Flutter marketplace uses real Supabase

- Phase 6 (Integration): 3 subtasks, depends on [phase-3, phase-4, phase-5], parallel_safe=false
  - E2E marketplace verification
  - E2E payment methods verification
  - Production readiness check

Services Involved:
- user-web: Primary - Next.js 16 frontend (Port 3000)
  Role: Update Connect and Payment Methods pages to use real database
- user_app: Secondary - Flutter mobile app
  Role: Verify feature parity with web

Key Gaps Identified (Investigation Phase):
1. app/(dashboard)/connect/page.tsx - Uses mock data from lib/data/marketplace.ts
2. app/(dashboard)/payment-methods/page.tsx - Uses mock state, no real Razorpay
3. Missing server actions for marketplace CRUD operations
4. Missing create listing page

Database Tables Available:
- marketplace_listings, marketplace_categories, marketplace_favorites
- wallet_transactions, wallets
- payment_methods

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 3 (phases 1, 2, 5 can run together)
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups: [phase-1-marketplace-backend, phase-2-payment-backend, phase-5-flutter-verification]

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: HIGH (payment integration)
- Security scanning: REQUIRED
- Staging deployment: REQUIRED
- Test types: unit, integration, e2e

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 001 --parallel 2

Or manually start development:

  cd user-web && npm run dev

Then verify these pages:
  - http://localhost:3000/connect (should show real data or empty state)
  - http://localhost:3000/payment-methods (should integrate with Razorpay)
  - http://localhost:3000/wallet (already uses real data - reference)

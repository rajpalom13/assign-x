/// A data model representing a writer/doer who can be assigned to projects.
///
/// This model encapsulates all information about a doer including their
/// profile, expertise areas, ratings, and availability status. It maps to
/// the `doers` table in Supabase with joined data from `profiles` and
/// `doer_subjects` tables.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// final doer = DoerModel.fromJson(supabaseResponse);
/// print(doer.initials); // "JD"
/// print(doer.qualificationDisplay); // "Postgraduate"
/// ```
///
/// ## Database Mapping
///
/// The model expects joined data in the following format:
/// - `profile`: from `profiles` table via `profile_id`
/// - `subjects`: from `doer_subjects` with nested `subject` from `subjects`
///
/// See also:
/// - [DoerReview] for doer reviews
/// - [RequestModel] for project assignments

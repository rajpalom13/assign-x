/// A data model representing a price quote for a project.
///
/// This model encapsulates all pricing information for a project quote,
/// including the total price, fee breakdown, and payment distribution
/// between doer, supervisor, and platform. It maps to the `project_quotes`
/// table in Supabase.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// final quote = QuoteModel(
///   requestId: 'project-123',
///   totalPrice: 150.00,
///   doerAmount: 100.00,
///   supervisorAmount: 35.00,
///   platformAmount: 15.00,
/// );
/// print(quote.totalPrice); // 150.00
/// ```
///
/// ## Database Mapping
///
/// Field mappings:
/// - `totalPrice` -> `user_amount`
/// - `requestId` -> `project_id`
/// - Other fields map directly with snake_case conversion
///
/// See also:
/// - [QuoteItem] for line item details
/// - [RequestModel] for the project being quoted
/// - [createDefaultQuoteItems] for generating default pricing

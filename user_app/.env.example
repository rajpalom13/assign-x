# AssignX Environment Configuration
# ================================
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to .env: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Fill in your Supabase credentials from https://supabase.com/dashboard
# 3. NEVER commit .env to version control!
#
# The .env file is automatically loaded by:
# - ./scripts/run.sh (for development)
# - ./scripts/build.sh (for builds)
# - VS Code launch configurations (via ${env:VAR_NAME})
#
# For VS Code to pick up environment variables:
# - On macOS/Linux: Variables from your shell are used
# - On Windows: Set variables in System Properties or use direnv
# - Alternative: Use the terminal to run flutter directly with ./scripts/run.sh

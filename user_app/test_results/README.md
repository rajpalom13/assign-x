## Test Results Files

### TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md
Main test results document containing:
- Overall test statistics
- Visual accuracy scores
- Performance metrics
- Issues summary
- Recommendations

### screenshots/

- Full page screenshots for comparison
- Component-specific close-ups
- Different states (loading, error, etc.)
- Various screen sizes (if tested)

### performance/
Performance testing data:
- Load time measurements
- Frame rate data

## How to Use

### After Running Tests

1. **Review TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md** for overall results
2. **Compare screenshots** with reference images from planner
3. **Check performance/** for any bottlenecks
4. **Review issues/** for items needing attention
5. **Share results** with reviewer agent via memory hooks

### Accessing Results

```bash
# View summary
cat test_results/TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md

# View screenshots
open test_results/screenshots/dashboard/full_page.png

# Check coverage
flutter pub global activate coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

## Status

**Current Status**: ⏳ Awaiting coder completion

- Test plan created ✅
- Test files prepared ✅
- Test execution pending ⏳
- Results pending ⏳

**Next Steps**:
1. Wait for coder agents to complete implementation
2. Run automated tests
3. Perform manual testing on emulator
4. Capture screenshots and metrics
5. Generate TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md
6. Report to reviewer agent
